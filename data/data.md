Data about  genome sequences of SARS-related corona viruses gathered from the following link on July 9, 2021:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202%20(SARS-CoV-2),%20taxid:2697049&VirusLineage_ss=Middle%20East%20respiratory%20syndrome-related%20coronavirus%20(MERS-CoV),%20taxid:1335626&VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome-related%20coronavirus,%20taxid:694009&QualNum_i=50&Region_s=Africa&Region_s=Asia&Region_s=South%20America&Completeness_s=complete

Genomes of genomes of SARS-CoV (Severe accute respiratory syndrom-related Coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East repiratory syndrom-related Coronavirus), and SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID19) were selected and filtered by only completed genomes with ambiguous characters set to 50, and only from Asia, South America, and Africa. 
The header was customized to include the Accession number, the species, the isolation source, and the Geo location.
